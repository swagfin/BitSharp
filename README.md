# BitSharp
A little BitTorrent client made in C#

This is just a small side project to learn more about BitTorrent and networking. It will consist of a library as well as a simple app that uses the library. So most of the focus would be on the library. (At least this is the plan :grin:)

## Useful resources
Special thanks to all the people who provided much needed guidance in the cruel world of protocol specifications. They can be quite scary (and boring).
