# BitSharp
A little BitTorrent client made in C#

Picture having a Web Platform to Download Torrents for on your server, then download the torrents using Internet Download Manager(IDM). This Implementation was to develop something like https://sider.cc  :grin:

This is just a small side project to learn more about BitTorrent and networking. The Project also is built and extends Mono Torrent Library
